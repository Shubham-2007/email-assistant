John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.

Dear Sara,

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

<7563011.1075845766170.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ESA equipment purchase,"Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.
 
Kay","Review the draft MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.; Review the proposed closing timeline, considering the involvement of WestLB and the alternative approach involving Lisa.; Consider the payment structure involving GE, ENA (or WestLB's successor), and ESA.; Check the recalculated overhead charge.; Provide Kay with comments.","- Kay sent Ben a draft MOU for the sale of LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.
- The timing of the transaction's closing is uncertain due to WestLB's ownership and the desire to avoid their involvement. The transfer might occur at the end of the WestLB facility's term unless an alternative is sought by consulting with Lisa.
- A second issue involves the payment structure where GE would receive payments from both ENA (or WestLB's successor) and ESA, depending on the type of expenses. This has not been discussed with GE yet.
- Kay recalculated the overhead charge.","Dear Ben,

Thank you, Kay, for the update and the draft MOU.

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 


A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior.

Subject: Early Warning Information: EEMF and EME in the press


Energy guru warns against dangers of 'industry squeeze'
ENERGY liberalisation in Europe is vulnerable to political interference in
the wake of the crisis on America's West Coast, according to a leading
industry player.
The warning comes from Jonathan Green, a director at Edison Mission Energy -
one of the companies caught up in the California crisis which has seen
millions of homes left without power as prices surge by up to 50%. ""As a
result of California, politicians are much more sensitive now about the
possibility of things going wrong,"" said Green.
The London-based Edison strategist was speaking to European Voice after a
conference of major pan-European power firms at the European Energy
Millennium Forum in Brussels last week. The companies voiced their concerns
over environmental and other political factors that could squeeze the
industry, leading to the capacity problems seen across the Atlantic. ""The
danger will come if there is some sort of constraint on new capacity coming
forward,"" Green added.
Both fuel price increases and 'stranded costs' - debt carried over from
capital investments under previous regimes - can be passed on to consumers
in the early stages of liberalisation, thereby making the process
politically unpopular.
Industry maintains that environmental pressures contributed to the
California crisis by imposing heavy costs on the building of new plants.
""Equally in Europe you can see pressures for older plants to close down
because of emissions,"" said Green.
Euro-MPs are currently in conciliation talks with EU governments over new
emissions limits for large power plants that could force older generators to
shut down for part of the year. Negotiations resume next week.

<26500636.1075857815381.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,CES Daily April '00 Requirements for 4/20/00 and after,"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/20  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are two  worksheets labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

Subject:	HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002 

By DANIEL ALTMAN


 

Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect. 

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it."" 

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities. 

*  
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors. 

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas. 

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. 

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work."" 

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business."" 

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand. 

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform."" 

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" 

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there."" 

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" 

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. 

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing."" 

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do."" 

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. 

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today. 

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking. 

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story."" 

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors. 

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said. 

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access 
the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron:

1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and 
are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server
2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our 
network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or 
Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID).

Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and 
limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work.  In 
any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through 
Information Risk Management/Notes Administration.    I'm sure this is not 
very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

<2118176.1075858676530.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Yesterday's Hearing in Kansas,"Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
 
From:  Don Schultz
To:      Kansas JDT Participants
Re:      10/15/01 motion hearing
           A  transcript has been ordered.   Below is my recap. I  encourage other attendees to reply with  corrections or additions you think  would be helpful to folks who did not attend.
           1.   Overall Impressions
           Rex  Sharp's arguments were unclear, complicated, and at times  inconsistent.   I think plaintiffs' lawyers left the Court with  the impression that they are in disarray, not well organized, and  not ready to proceed with a workable approach to the  case.    
         Dave Rebein did an  excellent job of illustrating how bizaare this case is in scope  and substance - you'll want to read the ""motorcycle story"" he told Judge  Smith at the start of his argument to illustrate this.  His  creative approach struck a chord; Judge Smith put his hands in  front of his face in order not to laugh so obviously, but laugh he  did.
          Jim Griffin showed  the Judge that the defendants have invested thousands of  hours collectively to produce the information on their Kansas contacts, and  ably reviewed the case law which frowns on allowing discovery into either p.jd.  or merits where a conspiracy has been pleaded only in conclusory  terms.
         Jim and Dave  presented coordinated, clear arguments and presented  them persuasively.   Their hard preparation work, and that of the  Akin Gump team and many other volunteers, seemed to me to pay off in a  very strong showing.
          Smith listened  to the arguments without saying much or asking questions.   My  sense at the conclusion of the arguments was that the Judge had not read much of  the defendants' briefs, but that Messrs. Rebein and Griffin had  made compelling arguments in line with those in the briefs, whereas Sharp's  arguments remained muddled.  Smith's comments and decisions on the  motions, thus far are summarized as follows.
           2.   Sharp's Pseudo Motion to Compel.  
          Judge Smith  will review the interrogs and requests for production which Sharp  served as ""personal jurisdiction"" discovery.  He will issue some form of  order or statement - he said by this Friday - which identifies those questions  which go too far - are outside what he contemplated in the case management order  as ""limited"" personal jurisdiction discovery, versus those questions he  thinks defendants should answer because they bear on personal  jurisdiction.  This will not constitute a ruling on any  objections.   
            The  defendants will have ten days to further answer or object to any of the  discovery which the Court finds is within the intent of the case management  order as to the scope of personal jurisdiction issues.    Judge  Smith said that he wants future discovery objections to be filed with/sent to  him immediately so he can get a response from the other side and rule on  objections quickly - he wants to know about discovery objections  ""before God hears the news"" (something like that).
         Judge Smith gave a  brief overview of the parties' opposing  positions on the scope of  permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to  ""contacts"" and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits  discovery.  He did not seem prepared to agree with either party  completely.  He said that it was his intent from the outset to spare  the defendants from full merits discovery until he determined the scope of  the court's jurisdiction, and it seemed that he intends to continue to draw  a distinction between limited and full discovery.  Pointing to a blow-up  which Messrs. Rebein and Griffin used, he indicated that some of the requests do  appear to go well beyond personal jurisdiction  issues.   He also said, though, that the jurisdictional  issues may not be limited to ""contacts"" as the defendants contend.   
           I left the  courtroom unsure how Smith will decide which questions he thinks are within  and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the CMO allows.  It  is not clear whether he will look at the law on the sufficiency of pleading  a conspiracy, or whether he will look at the case law on whether or  not pleading a conspiracy can extend the scope of  personal jursdiction to reach ""no-contacts"" alleged conspirators.    Neither side really pushed him to decide those legal points now.   He  left himself all options as still open.   I had  the impression that the Judge had not read the discovery requests at  all - even though defendants had attached them as an exhibit - and that  he expects (perhaps naively) that the boundary between limited  personal jurisdiction and merits discovery to be clear to him as he  looks at the questions one at a time.  
       Sharp tendered to the Judge a copy of  the Tejas defendants objections and answers.  Other defense counsel  requested leave to submit their defendants' responses and  objections.   The Court finally realized that the defendants were  concerned he would be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the  various objections, and so made clear he is only going to now evaluate Sharp's  questions, give some guidance on which questions seem within the scope of the  order, and the defendants can make objections as needed.
       The Judge seemed frustrated that  Sharp had not provided him the discovery questions with his motion, and  also seemed perturbed by the form of the motion.  He said ""I don't  know what this motion is . . . there is no such motion . . .  Plaintiffs are just making stuff up . . . I don't like it when parties make  stuff up, because then I don't know what to do.""
             3.  PSCo - Colorado and KCS motions to compel.   Jim  Eisenbrandt and Jim Flaherty argued persuasively that Plaintiffs should have to  respond to the personal jurisdiction discovery they had submitted, even if the  answers are that the plaintiffs don't have evidence to support jurisdiction over  individual defendants.   Judge Smith denied Sharp's motion for a  protective order that plaintiffs not have to respond to that  discovery.   He rejected Sharp's argument that it is not ""fair""  for plaintiffs to have to respond when the defendants have asserted  objections.   As with Sharp's questions, Judge Smith will review  the questions submitted by KCS and PSCo and identify those which the plaintiffs  must answer.   Dan Church will submit his separate discovery  served on the plaintiffs, since he asked some additional and different  questions.  
           4.   Discussion of Case Management Order
          In arguing  his motion, Sharp emphasized that with the passage of time and lack of  discovery he does not believe the CMO deadlines on the personal  jurisdiction motion can be met.  Later, off the record, after the  arguments, Sharp and Kerry McQueen ""apprised"" the Court that Mike Moore  cannot attend to this case due to the illness of his office manager, that Moore  cannot be deposed for the foreseeable future as a class representative, and that  Moore may have to reevaluate in about a month whether he even wants to  participate in this case (McQueen said if Moore does not want to participate  then he and Sharp will face some ""hard decisions""). 
         Though Sharp  reiterated, at points in his arguments, that he thinks the class certification  should proceed ahead of the personal jurisdiction factual motions because  the latter require discovery tantamount to merits discovery, he also seems  to want to delay class certification, but has been unclear in that respect.  
        There were no formal  proposals made to change the CMO, and no rulings to do so.  The Judge  indicated that if the parties agree to change the CMO deadlines and schedule, he  will not have a problem doing so, subject to him deciding the hearing  dates.  He wants the events calendared at all times to give him  management control over the case, but he is amenable to changing the time  lines. 
        I think both sides  will wait to see what the Judge says about the scope of ""limited personal  jurisdiction discovery,"" then re-evaluate how to proceed with CMO  negotiations.  It seems likely to me that we will get to the  hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without the discovery having  progressed far in substance.  It is not at all clear whether the  defendants will still want to, or be able to, continue pressing forward  with the personal jurisdiction motion (including undertaking needed discovery),  and a decision on same, before class certification.  Judge Smith still  seems to think that is the correct logical sequence for the case, but his  guidance on the discovery scope will be pivotal.  
            Don.",,"*   Don Schultz summarized the hearing in Kansas, noting Rex Sharp's unclear arguments and Dave Rebein and Jim Griffin's persuasive presentations.
*   Judge Smith will review Sharp's discovery requests to determine their scope, with defendants having ten days to respond or object.
*   The Judge denied Rex Sharp's motion for a protective order.
*   The parties will likely re-evaluate the Case Management Order (CMO) after the Judge's decision on discovery scope.","Dear Kansas JDT Participants,

FTC To Boost Staff By 40% As Probe Requests Rise 
TOKYO (Nikkei)--The Fair Trade Commission will increase its staff by 40% from 
the current 570 to 800 in five years under its medium-term plan, The Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun learned Tuesday.
In particular, the FTC aims to beef up its inspection functions to prevent 
illegal activities, such as price cartels and obstruction of entry into the 
information and data communications market. The upgraded inspection ability 
will also speed up the screening of mega-mergers for approval, thus helping 
accelerate ongoing industrial realignment in Japan.
Most of the planned increases will come in Tokyo, where the number of 
inspection division personnel investigating cases such as cartels will be 
doubled from the current 200.
With deregulation, the number of filings from businesses requesting FTC 
probes has increased sharply. In fiscal 2000, such filings totaled 2,878, up 
33.7% from a year earlier. But in many cases, personnel shortages prevented 
the FTC from making thorough investigations or it took too long to complete 
them.
The plan will also enhance the FTC's ability to protect consumers. With the 
expansion of online shopping, the number of products with misleading labels 
has increased sharply. The FTC will increase the number of personnel to 
oversee and prevent such malpractice.
The FTC will seek to have the proposals in the plan incorporated into a set 
of guidelines to be compiled in late June by the Council on Economic and 
Fiscal Policy headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
q",,"- The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will increase its staff by 40% (from 570 to 800) over five years.
- The increase aims to strengthen inspection functions, prevent illegal activities (price cartels, obstruction of market entry), and speed up merger screenings.
- Most staff increases will be in Tokyo, doubling the personnel investigating cases like cartels.
- The FTC plans to enhance consumer protection, particularly regarding online shopping.
- The FTC seeks to have its proposals incorporated into guidelines by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.","Dear All,

Thank you for sharing this informative update regarding the Fair Trade Commission's planned staff increase. It appears to be a significant development for the FTC, as well as for the overall economic environment in Japan. The focus on strengthening inspection functions and consumer protection is noteworthy.

Subject: CA Development I and II notice of exercise of purchase option

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

		 Subject: Corp Prepay

As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the 
prepaid swap structure . They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying 
credit default swaps in the market. However under credit default swaps, only 
a default on debt as defined by GAAP is  included as a credit event, and 
swaps are excluded from this definition .  This basis risk  therefore occurs 
where  Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt. This 
does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection, their recourse 
will then be through  the Corp guarantee with time delays. 

To mitigate that risk it was proposed that  in the event of an Enron default 
under the prepaid swap, the MTM termination value of the swap would be 
converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan. 
TD's counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean 
legal opinion on this  structure.

We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron 
entering into a loan of $10.1m at the same time as the swap is executed. This 
loan will  be in the name of Enron Corp. In the event of an Enron default on 
the prepaid swap, this will cross default into the $10.1m   loan and that 
forms the required trigger for TD's  credit default swaps.   The lawyers 
signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan 
documentation.
They are basing it on the May 2000, 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are 
expecting first draft tomorrow. I will forward this to you when I receive it.


The deal itself is still undefined as TD have  credit approval subject to 
presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of 
credit protection in place prior to executing the trade.
The confirm/term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have 
forwarded Sara's  comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit 
approval rather than docs until today.  We have not sent a confirm to Morgan 
Stanley yet as we plan to replicate  whatever  confirm we agree with TD.

After speaking with Richard Burchfield and Brian Hudson, I thought that it 
would be appropriate to update both of you and Beth as to IT's commitment.  
Richard asked that he send out the message and I agreed.  One reason for 
doing this was to show that the Operations and IT groups are working together 
towards a common goal.  The other reason was to ensure that I had IT's buy-in 
to completing this database in a timely fashion.

Our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business 
would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in Q1 
2001.  The actual roll out will happen in phases prior to January so that we 
begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture, 
valuation, and the necessary reporting and accounting tools.  By using Brian 
Hudson's IT team I can be assured that the global needs are met.

I will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further,

Todd,
 Per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a Weather 
Trading and Valuation engine.  I have discussed the high level requirements 
with Joseph Koothrappaly and have identified an IT lead to manage the 
project. As discussed, the project will have the same project formula as the 
""Thunderball"" project with 3-6 month deliverables. Also, the need to have 
co-operative development between Houston and London will be established for 
Global roll out of the Weather system. The main focus will be a intranet 
trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine. The plan calls 
for Phase I roll out for January 1, 2001.   Next steps will need to be 
discuss as soon as possible.  Topics that need to be addressed are definition 
of Phase I, joint development between Houston and London, and duel 
development between Steve Stock's valuation team and my trading team. Keep in 
mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments, one person 
will manage the effort across teams.

The existing imbalances as of the effective date of the tariff OBA will have to be individually negotiated with the party to resolve separate and apart from any imbalance that occurs under the new OBA.  TW's tariff states that if the OBA party does not execute/sign the tariff OBA, they are still subject to the tariff OBA if they physically receive or deliver gas into/out of Transwestern's system. These relationships will have to be managed carefully from all sides to resolve the old imbalances while moving forward with the tariff OBA for new imbalances.

I agree with your interpretation.

I would recommend that we don't eliminate the ""Blanket"", but rather arrange a sit down meeting with NNG - Dynegy to explain what each ""Blanket"" consists of and obtain approval for what we plan to spend within each blanket.   If they place restrictions on the blanket expenditures, then we get those restrictions spelled out and we live within their limits.

We can identify every vehicle that needs replaced in 2002 and the Large Tools.   Computers probably can be justified based on historical turnover, etc.

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Heartland Industrial Partners

Dave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million 
in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.  The terms of 
the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for a 
limited partner such as we).  The deal was ""sold"" on the basis of ENA getting 
exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by 
the fund if these were cost effective.  The claimed benefits for the energy 
management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.  The deal was originated 
by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment had been 
assigned to Jim Ajello.

The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now 
provided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their 
business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this 
kind of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment 
(and capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the 
normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership 
has a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest 
after 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair 
price or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except in 
my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move to 
EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the 
investment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to 
monetize funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining 
commitment.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership 
interests, however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our 
investment/commitment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances 
finding a buyer will be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster 
child for ""patient"" investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is 
that the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed 
the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.",Delainey needs to take a closer look at the Heartland Industrial Partners investment fund and their current investments portfolio.,"*   Richard Lydecker (ENRON) informed David W Delainey (HOU/ECT) about Enron North America's (ENA) $30 million investment in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P. in May 2000.
*   The investment was originally intended to secure exclusive rights for ENA to provide energy management services to the fund's companies.
*   The energy management services are now provided by EES, which is uninterested in taking on the investment commitment.
*   The investment's future is uncertain, and there is no clear place for it within ENA, with a question raised about whether EIM should assume responsibility.
*   Delainey, in the email, is considering the Heartland Industrial Partners investment and is requesting information from Richard Lydecker on the investment fund and its current portfolio.
*   Delainey also rejects the idea of EES taking on the Catalytica investment.","Dear Richard,

Thank you for the detailed information regarding the Heartland Industrial Partners investment. I understand the situation and will review the fund's information and portfolio as requested.

Regarding the Catalytica investment, I concur with your assessment. EES will not be taking on this commitment.

 Sokol said at press conference yesterday","This is yet another, tangible case of why price caps don't and can't help; 
they can and will only make matters worse.  Caps are a policy chainsaw when a 
scalpel is needed.  The result of the caps being imposed on QFs by Davis and 
the Legislature will be shut downs and bankruptcy, which will reduce supply 
and decrease reliability----the exact opposite of what the state needs to be 
doing.

FYI:  I listened in to Sokol's conference call yesterday re: court case 
freeing CalEnergy from the QF contract.  Sokol blasted Edison over and over 
(e.g., accumulated war chest of over $2 billion in cash).  Sokol said that, 
at least for the time being, this lessens the need for CalEnergy specifically 
to force an involuntary.  Be interesting to see if other QFs take similar 
tack.  Sokol also said that CalEnergy has sold the power to El Paso---lot's 
of press questions about price and where the power's headed (i.e., in our out 
of state).   He said he expects to get a ""market price"" from El Paso and that 
if the ""prices are higher out of state, well.......""

? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This 
will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it 
with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year 
contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, 
this is ""locked in to pass.""  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on 
Monday.
 
? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they 
would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to 
operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired 
QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to 
either operate unprofitably or shut down.
 
? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an 
involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram 
Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in 
Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as ""extremely aggressive.""

To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: follow-up to EBR  

Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.",,"*   Doug Leach provided examples of various requests from Enron entities handled in a single day.
*   Requests included: Panama office (EGE-MINSA) needing budget help; Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico needing historical NYMEX NX3 prices; Buenos Aires office needing help with EOL rollout and hedge prices; Guatemala office (PQPC) with a sulfur issue; Mariella Mahan's group needing help with resid into Nicaragua; Weather group needing historical propane prices; San Paulo office requesting a twenty-year forward curve; Metgas in India needing a naphtha hedge; ENA discussing jet fuel; Rob Bradley needing help with the Enron Washington, DC office.
*   The email highlights the wide range of support provided to various Enron entities.
*   Doug Leach mentions previous memos regarding India, Guatemala, and Panama, which exceeded $20MM in savings.","Dear Mike McConnell,

Thank you for the detailed overview of the requests handled. It's helpful to understand the scope of support provided by Doug Leach and the team to various Enron entities like EGE-MINSA, Ecoelectrica, PQPC, Mariella Mahan's group, Conoco, San Paulo office, Metgas in India, ENA, and the Enron Washington, DC office, as well as the projects in Buenos Aires, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Florida, and Panama.

Tony hasn't returned from Vegas yet.  As of Friday, he thought that he could still get some harper gas. 

 Sorry for the delay.  I don't really understand why takes so long, but I suspect it's the people TC deals with.  He is pretty diligent, but they don't always give him a straight answer

It looks like we are going to release most of NBPL capacity that we have (55,000 of the 100,000).  Mirant & BP want the Haper to Chicago capacity for $.08 and Dynergy wants Vent to Chicago for $.12.  PGL wants to exchange their manhattan to North Hayden for the remaining Vent to harper, so there may an opportunity to have PGL buy Vent and sell you Harper, but dealing with PGL is even slower that dealing with Tony.

I'll talk to Tony as soon as I see him

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the ""market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets."" He added: ""It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets."" 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, ""I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe."" 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,"" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. ""We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery."" 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. ""If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dietert says. ""In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow."" 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, ""Why? Ask why."" 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  ""I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants"" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, ""and it's never
been in the news,"" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. ""My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion."" 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  ""Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,"" Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  ""I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance,"" Doot said. ""Those things have in fact
happened from time to time.""

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking ""non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,"" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

		 Subject: Canadian Counsel

Mark, a few thoughts:

1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his ""very 
positive meeting"" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am very 
tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hope 
that is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue 
and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also 
concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and 
Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trust 
and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within 
Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes 
resources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates 
the talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others 
out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan 
is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our 
work under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to 
commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the 
senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions, 
particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place 
in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust 
and confidence of Rob Milnthorp.

2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the 
initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and 
Morris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just of 
their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think that 
Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and 
likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely 
cannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY 
initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail 
market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all 
conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (We 
first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones, 
which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically use 
but which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited written 
propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail 
team.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very well 
situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of 
deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems 
in Toronto for market opening.

3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th 
outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?  
Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurd 
call anticipated?

Peter.


Peter.",,"- Mark and Peter discussed replacing Dan Fournier as Canadian counsel.
- Peter expressed concerns about Dan Fournier's approach at Blakes and his potential return to a leading role with Enron. Peter has lost trust and confidence in Dan Fournier.
- Peter provided context on the use of Donahue Ernst & Young (DEY), highlighting the role of Jordan Mintz and Morris Clark, and the benefits of their multidisciplinary business model, including their work on regulatory and contracting issues where Blakes, Bennett Jones, and Stikemans had conflicts.
- Peter asked if he should send Jim a proposed agenda for their call on the 20th, listing current Canadian counsel (Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y).","Dear Mark,

Thank you for the detailed update. I understand your concerns regarding Dan Fournier and the importance of considering alternative counsel.

 PRODUCT","Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

Subject:	RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or  ""Est RT$""  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

<14321254.1075843031652.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Re: Dow,"Greetings.  The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC 
first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in 
California.  We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were 
pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on 
the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.  It 
was in the press.  So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals.  
Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it 
had planned to developed.  I think that they announced the same amount would 
be pulled---300 MWs.

If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.

 Jeff:  is this story true that ""Enron plans to pull out of the market in 
California?""
 

*    FERC COMMISSIONER HERBERT SKIPS SAN DIEGO HEARING
     FERC's sole Republican commissioner will not be attending
today's hearings in San Diego, saying the situation has gotten
too political, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
     Commissioner Curt Herbert was quoted as saying: ""California
would rather fight this out for the next five to ten years rather
than take steps now to solve the problem."" He also expects
additional companies to join Enron Corp. and Calpine Corp. in
pulling out of the state's market, causing blackouts and ongoing
high prices next summer. ""We've had three hearings already,""
Herbert added. ""Are customers better off? I don't think so.""
     Meanwhile, State senator Debra Bowen, head of the state
Senate Energy Committee, told a hearing in Sacramento yesterday
that FERC's plan could lead to re-regulation if residents were
not protected from market manipulation. Reuters quotes Bowen as
saying: ""If there's not political accountability between the
people that are making the decisions about what California
customers pay and the people who are paying those rates, we're
likely to have a revolution at the consumer level that leads to
re-regulation regardless of what's in a FERC order"" (Dow Jones
Newswires, Reuters, Nov. 13).",,"*   Jeff clarifies that statements about Enron pulling out of the California market refer to the withdrawal of 300 MW of power plants due to FERC's price cap proposal.
*   Calpine also announced a similar withdrawal of 300 MW of peaking plants.
*   FERC Commissioner Curt Herbert is skipping the San Diego hearing, citing the situation's political nature. He anticipates more companies, including Enron Corp. and Calpine Corp., will pull out of the market.
*   State Senator Debra Bowen suggests FERC's plan could lead to re-regulation if market manipulation isn't addressed.","Dear Cynthia Sandherr,

Thank you for the clarification. It appears the news regarding Enron pulling out of the California market specifically pertains to the 300 MW of power plants, as explained by Jeff Dasovich. The information also references Calpine's similar decision. The situation with FERC Commissioner Curt Herbert and Senator Debra Bowen's comments adds further context to the market dynamics.

Thank you,

All these provisions make a lot of sense. Anjam showed very poor judgment one 
more time.
He got a very generous offer to move to Houston.

I recommend keeping him on the payroll, and at home, as long as possible.

Subject: Actions on Anjam's resignation

All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

Steve",,"*   Steve recommends a course of action regarding Anjam's departure, focusing on minimizing risk to Enron.
*   Key concerns include potential data/code theft and confidentiality breaches.
*   Richard Lewis will discuss confidentiality with Anjam.
*   Vince J Kaminski suggests keeping Anjam on payroll and at home as long as possible.","Subject: Re: Actions on Anjam's resignation

Dear All,

Thank you for the detailed information and recommendations regarding Anjam's departure. I understand the concerns about data security and the importance of addressing them promptly. I will be sure to follow up on these points and assist where needed.
