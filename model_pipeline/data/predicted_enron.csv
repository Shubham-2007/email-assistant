"," Dear Catherine,

Thanks for reaching out! I understand the frustration with mobile service. While I don't have a *national* service I can personally recommend, as I primarily use a local provider, I've heard good things about Verizon and AT&T from colleagues. They often get mentioned in the context of good nationwide coverage.

Hope this helps!
