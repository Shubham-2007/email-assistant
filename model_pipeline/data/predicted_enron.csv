"," Dear [Recipient],

Thank you for reaching out. The current market volatility, particularly in the NASDAQ, is certainly a concern for many investors. Predicting future market movements, including potential losses of 30% or more, is inherently difficult.

Whether to remain invested for the long term or adjust your strategy is a complex decision that depends on several factors, including your individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. A ""buy and hold"" strategy, weathering short-term downturns, can be suitable for long-term investments, but it's crucial to evaluate your comfort level with potential losses.

I am an AI, and cannot provide financial advice. It might be worthwhile to consult with a qualified financial advisor, like someone at your current brokerage, who can assess your specific situation and help you develop a personalized investment plan that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. They can also provide further analysis of your particular holdings.

Thank you for the information regarding Robin Barbe's sale to EES. I understand the volume is 1200 dt/day, with delivery options at Tenn Zone 5, meter #20816, or on CNG (Dominion), meter DOMSP, both at the same contract price.

the litigation between Power Systems and GE and I expect that numerous

etc. on the existing equipment and the legal opinions on the new equipment 
that Power Systems is trying to sell us)?  If so, please have Linda put this 
together ASAP.  Please ask her to separate the information dealing with the 
existing problems from the information on the possible solutions (i.e. new 
Power Systems technology currently being offered).  This is because I do not

I need to speak with you about the foregoing.

(1)  Re:  the Chase Global Custody Agreemnet

Are you OK with Chase's ability to setoff amounts in any ENA Chase accounts 
against amount which ENA may owe under the Global Custody Agreement?  Does 
ENA have many accounts with Chase?

(2)  Re:  Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC"")

(1) Re: the Chase Global Custody Agreement: I understand Chase's potential setoff rights. I will need to review ENA's current account structure with Chase to assess the implications fully. I do not currently have information regarding the number of accounts ENA maintains with Chase.

(2) Re: Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. (""GSC""): I will need to analyze the repo agreement and the Enron Corp. guaranty to provide a comprehensive response. At this stage, I do not have any immediate concerns, but a thorough review is required.

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael","
- Michael reported that PG&E's Schedule F, detailing nonpriority unsecured claims in bankruptcy, listed PX credit amounts as disputed.
- The Schedule F disclosed PX credits for Enron Energy Marketing ($201,964,905.64) and Enron Energy Services ($19,737,979.97), totaling $221,702,885.61.
- Michael noted their calculation of the PX credit at the beginning of May was $392,416,534, significantly higher than the disclosed amount.
- This information is now public, along with $53,985,167 in other Enron-related claims.
- Rick Buy was asked how to investigate the discrepancy with PG&E.
"," Determine with PG&E the source of the discrepancy between the listed PX credit amounts in Schedule F and the internal calculation ($392,416,534).
"," Dear Rick,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

I believe the best course of action to determine the discrepancy between the disclosed PX credit amounts in PG&E's Schedule F and our internal calculations is to directly contact PG&E. We should inquire about the basis for their listed amounts, specifically those related to Enron Energy Marketing and Enron Energy Services, and understand the methodology used in the valuation of these claims. Perhaps a dedicated team or individual at PG&E is responsible for handling these claims and could provide the necessary details. We should prepare a formal inquiry referencing the specific schedule and the Enron entities, including the amounts listed for Enron Energy Marketing at $201,964,905.64 and Enron Energy Services at $19,737,979.97. We should also clarify why no PX Credit claims were listed for unknown amounts. This will allow us to reconcile our calculations and obtain a clearer understanding of the situation.

I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern 
that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of 
issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk 
management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a 
(by no means exhaustive) list:-

i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic 
options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option 
pricing add-ins)
ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we 
can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data 
for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist 
in this matter.
iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our 
methods and systems and vice versa

These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with 
relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the 
process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative

smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to

1.  I did not put a limit on the Clearly erroneous policy--not because I
didn't agree, but because I did not see an obvious answer in the Nasdaq
agreement.  I will look at it more tomorrow, but I wanted to get this to you
rather than delay further.
2.  Striking first sentence in 5.4--I have not heard back from our lawyers.
Hopefully tomorrow.

Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
have.

I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.

If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Amy Hespenheide","

While I am not in a position to directly address the matters you've raised regarding Mr. Lay's actions, I acknowledge the significance of the issues you've highlighted, particularly the financial hardships faced by Enron employees and the challenges confronting low-income consumers in California.

In the meeting we had last month regarding background investigation policies, 
we discussed the area on our current application where the candidate is asked 
to disclose convictions, etc.  In some instances, the candidate could 
truthfully disclose nothing, yet have a misdemeanor conviction for theft, 
possession, etc.  or other charges that would be potential disqualifiers for 
a position with Enron.  Since the question is poorly phrased, you had 
recommended that this piece be reworded, and you suggested that Ryan Seleznov 
bring it up in the Recruiting Council.  I brought this up to Ryan, but she 
felt that this would probably be more in the province of your area or Felicia 
Acevedo.  Would you like to take this task on, or would it be more

<3777500.1075840542633.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ERCOT Zonal Load Forecasts,"Starting tomorrow (8/15), I will start publishing a load forecast for the North, West, and South zones in ERCOT.  The zonal forecasts will be run at the same time that the total ERCOT load forecast is being run.  I want to communicate how the zonal forecasts are being generated and the limitations of the zonal forecasts.

The zonal load forecasts are being generated using data from the ten old control areas.  I generate a load forecast for each of the old control areas and then portion out the loads in the appropriate amounts to each of the zones.  The reason I am generating a load forecast for each of the old control areas is for future use in the PowerWorld model.  I have load data through 12/31/2000 for each of these areas.  Each of the models is estimated from 7/1/1998 through 12/31/2000.  Since ERCOT is not publishing actual zonal loads at this time (let me know if that assumption is not correct), we are currently lagging nearly eight months of data and, obviously, this gap will continue to grow.  For these reasons, as well as the ones you are already aware of, East Power's forecasts of ERCOT's zonal loads could differ from the ISO's forecasts.

The zonal load forecasts are in the following location:

m:\electric\metrixnd\daily forecasts\first forecast\ERCOT Regional Load.xls (with tabs for each of the regions)


I will continue to publish a separate total ERCOT load forecast, the model of which is estimated from 1/1/1999 through 8/13/2001 (always containing the most current load data available).  The total ERCOT load forecast will differ from the sum of the zonal load forecasts due to the different estimation periods and the use of separate models.  A comparison between the ERCOT total load forecast and the sum of the zonal load forecasts shows that they are reasonably close.  You are welcome to do your own comparisons.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.","
- Starting 8/15, zonal load forecasts for North, West, and South zones in ERCOT will be published alongside the total ERCOT load forecast.
- Zonal forecasts are generated using data from the ten old control areas, with individual forecasts created for each, then apportioned to the zones.
- Forecast models for the old control areas are estimated from 7/1/1998 through 12/31/2000, using load data through 12/31/2000.
- ERCOT is not publishing actual zonal loads, resulting in a data lag of nearly eight months for these forecasts, potentially leading to differences from East Power's forecasts.
- Zonal load forecasts are located in ""m:\electric\metrixnd\daily forecasts\first forecast\ERCOT Regional Load.xls"".
- A separate total ERCOT load forecast, modeled from 1/1/1999 through 8/13/2001, will also be published; this may differ from the sum of the zonal forecasts.
"," Verify the assumption that ERCOT is not publishing actual zonal loads.
"," Dear [Sender],

Thank you for the detailed explanation regarding the new zonal load forecasts for the North, West, and South zones in ERCOT. The information about the methodology, data sources (including the ten old control areas), and the limitations associated with the forecasts is very helpful and clear. The location of the forecasts in ""m:\electric\metrixnd\daily forecasts\first forecast\ERCOT Regional Load.xls"" is also noted.

The difference between the ERCOT total load forecast and the sum of the zonal load forecasts due to different estimation periods is understandable. I appreciate your offering to conduct our own comparisons.

I will review the forecasts and the provided details. I may follow up with further questions if needed.

Best regards,

Hi Vince:

A few months ago we talked about a letter of recommendation to support my
green card application.  I am applying under the National Interest Waiver
program in order to short cut the labor certification process.  This
requires me to get letters of recommendation demonstrating that my continued
work in the US is in the national interest.  Based on the work that I have
been doing with utilities in risk management this appears to have a
reasonable chance.

Although we have not worked together recently, I was wondering if you would
consider writing a letter on my behalf.  I have worked with my immigration
lawyer to compose a draft letter that would be suitable.  I have attached
this letter as well as the letter from the lawyer explaining where to send
the refernce letter.

I am using a transaction that I worked on with Edison International as an
example of the sort of work that I do, since it was reported in the press.
Edison was unable to hedge its overall short position, so it bought asian
options on gas as a means of approximating the effect of higher energy
prices.  This has turned out to be an effective strategy.

If you have any questions or want to discuss this please contact me by
email, or on my cellphone at 917-446-4781.

Yours sincerely,
Lloyd Spencer.

find the following documents which have been blacklined to show the 
revisions: 
1. EEI Cover Sheet: 

a. I have made most of the changes suggested in Gayle's fax of 11/29 except 
that the definition of Performance Assurance needs to stay as it is given 
that it does not only mean the Escrowed Funds (for instance, in the event of 
Downgrade Event with respect to Enron Corp., EPMI would have to post 
Performance Assurance). We have also not amended the last line of Section 5.5 
since, among other things, the two amendments taken together would mean that 
in the event of a dispute, the Non-Defaulting Party would be limited to 
receiving only what is in the Escrow Fund. First, that would not work if we 
were the Defaulting Party and secondly, we believe that the Non-Defaulting 
Party should receive an amount equal to the Termination Payment. 

Also, with respect to Section 5.5, Tracy Ngo was willing to extend the 
Defaulting Party's response time from two days to five days, but not all the 
way out to ten days.     

b. Pages 1-2 still need to have information filled in by Black Hills.

2. Confirmation: I have incorporated the modifications John suggested 
regarding Black Hills supplying Energy from an alternative source. I have 
also made a few minor typographical changes. In addition, the Confirmation 
contains revised Escrow language which reflects the recent discussions 
between Richard, Tracy and John. 

I will be happy to incorporate the Escrow language in the La Salle Bank 
Escrow Agreement once someone from Black Hills lets me know that the Escrow 
language is acceptable as written. 

Thank you,

Jane:

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a ""template"", I gave a choice for Termination Date
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
(3)	We need to ""fix"" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to ""North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean"" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 

Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the ""TIBOR"" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

 << File: Final.doc >> Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Randy,

I have spoken with several contacts at OneOk in the recent past. Just this morning I talked with a Jerry Knight who works together with Delaine Kurth and he is supposed to let me know how the billing, etc. is being handled by WEGO.
Last week Lynn Blair talked with Delaine to see what could be done with the situation of WEGO hauling the so-called water (water is being marked as the substance being hauled on the run tickets, but we have done analysis from two lacations and have found it primarily condensate) from the locations at the Sublette Plant and the Morton Co. #1 dehys. If OneOk is not receiving the revenue from this condensate, then in turn ETS does not receive the BTU replacements for the gas for UAF purposes as our contract states.
We have resolved the issue that was occuring in the same fashion at the Mt. Jesus station and are now being reimbursed by OneOk for this location's BTU replacements. I do not know if they changed trucking services or what, but it has been taken care of.
As far as setting up a face to face meeting with OneOk, that will be determined from OneOk's response to their findings through WEGO and their practices in hauling from these two points.
I will keep you updated as I am informed.

RB

It has come to light, by way of a Wego driver, that Enron has been billed for the liquids that were produced from Oneok facilities.  After further discussion it was discovered that the Hugoton plant as well as some field locations in the Liberal Region are also being billed to Enron instead of Oneok.  This problem may need to be investigated further and a plan to correct this implemented.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

FYI. Apparently we turned back sales customers in Arizona served by Southwest Gas but we are still on the hook for their gas costs.  Altho I was in contact with EES virtually daily since December on about the SW problems, I was told that we were able to terminate their contracts, and was not aware of the lingering exposure issue on pricing until I started getting emails last week.  Needless to say I am not pleased and EES is trying to find a regulatory fix to this problem.  If I had known about it last winter, I would have been able to explain it to them.  I don't think I can get this fixed, and they should have kept the customers, as the delivery problems cleared up in the spring.

Subject:	RE: Southwest Gas 

On cash-outs, Southwest takes the highest price paid for any incremental volume and applies it to all cash out volumes.  This is the issue we took up at the ACC and argued that it should be based on actual costs, not the single highest price.  BUT this is a different issue than the actual cost of gas for sales purposes.  I would think that the sales gas is based on actual incremental costs.  There is a possibility this can be audited, but we would have to go to the ACC, and as in California, they will not be at all sympathetic to us. They will view this an Enron problem.  I just say that so that you don't think that I can fix this easily (I doubt that I can fix this at all, but let's see what we get from the ACC on the cash out issue, that will be a good indicator.  We were clearly right on that one).

Leslie-
Is there any way to know what their incremental cost of gas is or how it is calculated?  For example, if SW Gas buys 10,000 MMBtu total for the month at $5.00 and all other purchases were at $3.00, and EES' sales gas for that month was 90,000 MMBtu, can they charge $5.00 for all 90,000?  Are there any audit rights?  Also, I heard that we hired a law firm awhile back to address this issue???  Do you know anything about that or what they did/accomplished?  You may be hearing more about this from Don Black or Jess Hewitt--there is a huge concern about our exposure this winter.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I understand the urgency of defining the issue with Southwest Gas and EES.

Regarding your suggestion of returning customers to sales service, I need to understand the potential implications and get further clarification from EES on the feasibility and any potential negative consequences.

Could you please provide me with more information, such as:

*   What specific information about the issue EES needs?
*   What are the specific issues or problems we might encounter if we move the customers back to sales service?
*   Are there any regulatory implications to be considered?

I will coordinate with EES, specifically addressing the concerns raised by Leslie Lawner regarding the gas costs and regulatory issues.

Subject: El Paso / ENA Deal Completely Terminated Now

El Paso, Enron Terminate $38 Million Mega-Deal

     In a stunning announcement late yesterday, El Paso Natural Gas said it 
had reached a
     ""mutual agreement"" with Enron North America Corp. to terminate the $38 
million
     negotiated mega-deal for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity that the marketer had 
entered into in
     December. The negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity 
agreements. 

     The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was 
somewhat
     puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one 
contract - the
     famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that 
FERC had
     placed on the delivery rights of the capacity. In a Jan. 27 letter, 
Enron notified El Paso
     of its intent to exit the Block II contract, but the letter didn't 
indicate that it wanted to
     terminate the Blocks I and III contracts. See Daily GPI, Feb. 3) 

     ""They asked for it [to be released] and we agreed to it. It was a mutual 
agreement,""
     said El Paso spokesman Mel Scott. The capacity agreements will be 
terminated on Jan.
     31. Afterward, El Paso said it will hold open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 
14 for the
     capacity. 

     ""It is unfortunate that the recent FERC order modified the capacity 
rights in a way that
     will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that Enron North 
America originally
     intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions. In the interest 
of fairness and
     good customer relations, we have agreed to release them from the 
contracts,"" said John
     W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group. 

     El Paso Natural Gas has asked FERC to reconsider the mid-January order 
that
     essentially has reduced the commercial value of the Block II firm 
transportation
     capacity that Enron had agreed to acquire. With the collapse of its 
contract deal with
     Enron, it couldn't be immediately determined whether El Paso will 
continue to pursue
     rehearing. 

     El Paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by FERC in its request 
to stay the
     provision in the order restricting delivery rights of Block II capacity. 

     The pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which FERC said El 
Paso's 1996
     turned-back capacity settlement bars El Paso from marketing Block II 
capacity on a
     primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at Pacific Gas &
     Electric-Topock, AZ. That ruling stripped the Block II capacity of 
primary delivery
     access to the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point, which is 
the most
     sought-after by shippers of San Juan Basin gas. 

     It was a major blow to El Paso and Enron, which had contracted for the 
Block II
     capacity in December on the condition that it would have primary 
delivery access to the
     Southern California market.. 

     Without a favorable decision on rehearing, ""the result may well be a 
diminution of the
     value of Block II capacity,"" El Paso told FERC. ""Without question, 
Enron, as a new
     shipper on the capacity"" and future holders of that capacity ""will 
suffer a disadvantage in
     the market...."" 

     El Paso contends the Commission's ruling, if unchanged, would thwart the 
intent of the
     1996 settlement, which called for the pipeline and its customers to 
share the risks of
     unsubscribed capacity on El Paso's system, and for El Paso to share a 
portion of the
     revenues it received from re-marketing the capacity. 

     ""An essential element in El Paso's ability to maximize the revenues it 
agreed to share
     with its firm customers was the ability to market the 614 MMcf/d of 
Block II capacity
     on a primary basis to delivery points other than PG&E-Topock,"" the 
pipeline noted.
     Stripping El Paso of delivery-point flexibility for Block II capacity 
""will have a serious
     adverse impact on [its] ability to generate the maximum possible 
revenues for its
     capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would 
otherwise have to
     absorb."" 

     El Paso further said the Commission's decision was at odds with a 1998 
order
     addressing whether the pipeline could re-market capacity turned back by 
PG&E to the
     SoCal-Topock delivery point on a primary basis. Since the 1996 
settlement was silent
     on whether El Paso could re-market the capacity to delivery points other 
than
     PG&E-Topock, the Commission reasoned the settlement didn't preclude El 
Paso from
     selling the capacity at SoCal-Topock. 

     ""That ruling established the proper interpretation of the 1996 
settlement. Now, the
     Commission has re-interpreted that same provision in a manner that is 
completely
     contrary to its previous ruling. The Commission provides no explanation 
as to how
     these two rulings can be reconciled or, alternatively, why it has 
changed its mind...."" 

     El Paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it ""cannot find any 
evidence"" in the
     mid-January order that the Commission ""even read, much less considered"" 
its response
     as to the ""proper interpretation"" of the1996 settlement."," - El Paso and Enron North America Corp. mutually agreed to terminate the $38 million deal for 1.2 Bcf/d capacity, covering three capacity agreements.
- The decision followed FERC restrictions on delivery rights, particularly impacting the Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d).
- El Paso will hold an open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 14 for the capacity.
- John W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group, stated that the release was agreed upon in the interest of fairness and good customer relations.
- El Paso sought a rehearing with FERC, contesting the ruling that reduced the commercial value of Block II capacity and limited delivery rights, specifically impacting the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point.
"," Acknowledge receipt of the information regarding the termination of the El Paso / ENA deal.
"," Dear Vince J Kaminski,

Thank you for forwarding this information. I appreciate being kept informed of the situation regarding the El Paso / ENA deal.

Sincerely,

		 Subject: Response to ORA/TURN petition

Mike - Here is the situation.  Between ENA and EES, we sell gas to core and 
non-core customers, and also have gas in storage as well as in the park and 
lend service.  I think we can be sympathetic to the ORA argument that the 
diversion tariff penalties did not anticipate OFOs and EFOs in situations 
such as we face here (shortages due to credit problems rather than lack of 
supply).  Assessing extreme penalties, as the OFO/EFOs would do, on users who 
are not perfectly imbalance under this situation certainly seems unfair.  
However, I think we should argue that limiting the payments to 
shippers/customers whose gas is diverted to serve core customers to a market 
index may not fully compensate for the diversion.  The pay back specifically 
does not include interstate pipeline charges, and there may be other costs as 
well to the marketer/customer who had supplies taken away.  

I need an estimate of the cost to make this filing and follow it up for the 
RCR process, and I would also like any feedback anyone has on what our 
position should be in this matter.  The response is due Friday.","
*   Leslie Lawner initiated a discussion regarding a response to the ORA/TURN petition, concerning diversion tariff penalties due to gas shortages.
*   Leslie seeks feedback on their proposed position, which suggests sympathy for the ORA argument but also emphasizes the need to fully compensate shippers/customers for diverted gas, including interstate pipeline charges.
*   Leslie needs an estimate of the filing cost and follow-up for the RCR process; the response is due Friday.
*   Jeff Dasovich and Susan Scott were asked to potentially help with pipeline charges.
*   Susan Scott is available to assist and requested a call to schedule a date.
*   Susan proposed Feb. 8, 14 or 15 as possible dates for the meeting.

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

*	Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
*	Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
*	Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
*	Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
*	In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
*	When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
*	Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
*	And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
*	Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By California Energy Commission

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an
Edison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 ""From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the California market,"" said John E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Edison International. ""This CEC approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project.""

 ""This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,""
said
 Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. ""Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &
 Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that
California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource,"" Fohrer said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 California legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to California by next summer.

 Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
As
 one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy
owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in
 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,
Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the
United
 Kingdom and the United States.

 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international
electric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With
a
 portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an
industry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets
and
 power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,
Southern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison
 O&M Services.

I think the scope is ""right on the money"" and the timing is reasonably good also.  The text of the audit solicitation follows the bullets.  I've made contact with Andy Sakallaris, head of FERC procurement, to attend the pre-bid conference next Tuesday (assuming it is held, since expressions of interest thus far have been from CA based firms unwilling to make the trip to DC).  Ray

Audit description-  FERC seeks to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements in California markets; accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO will be performed to determine any areas in which the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibilities in operating the transmission system under its control and administering real-time energy markets.

Scope- Provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its FERC tariff and determine whether the CAISO's operations are adequately transparent to market participants.

Audit period- 10/1/00-10/1/01

Deliverables timing- Draft report due on January 9, 2002; final report due January 16, 2002.

Audit schedule-  Begins on November 1, 2001, and ends no later than January 4, 2002.

POC Charlotte Handley, 202-219-1156 or Andrew Sakallaris,202-219-1150
DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial
  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,
  as supplemented with additional information included in this
  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;
  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will
  not be issued. FERC02RMT22071 is issued as a request for proposal
  and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC
  97-27. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number
  561. Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity
  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer
  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising
  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially
  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,
  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid
  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly
  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked
  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices
  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks
  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements
  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO
  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.
  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO
  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which
  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its
  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under
  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.
  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)
  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,
  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted
  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall
  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its
  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).
  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations
  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent
  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's
  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective
  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO
  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through
  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide
  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft
  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies
  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports
  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close
  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January
  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The
  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it
  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor
  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than
  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission
  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.
  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the
  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated
  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The
  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers
  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the
  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,
  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,
  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.
  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition
  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for
  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to
  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents
  will become the property of the Commission. During the course
  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's
  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and
  review by the Commission. A preproposal conference is scheduled
  for prospective offerors at FERC on Tuesday, October 16, 2001,
  at 10:00 am at 888 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426,
  Room 3M-3. FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements
  and clarify any questions asked. Questions submitted in advance

  the company names, points of contact and phone numbers are
  current. The Offeror and each subcontractor proposed must each
  select three references to complete a ""Contractor Past-Performance
  Evaluation."" All areas of the sheet must be filled in. If an
  answer to a specific question is not provided, the applicable
  area must be annotated with the reason why (e.g. ""Reference
  failed to provide an answer""). Higher scores will be assigned
  for contracts that are at least similar in size and complexity.
  FERC may obtain and evaluate information from sources other
  than those provided by the offeror. FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) states
  ""In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past
  performance or for whom information on past performance is
  not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or
  unfavorably on past performance."" For the purposes of this
  evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means
  the offeror will receive a rating of ""good or acceptable"" on
  company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance
  form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from
  A. Sakallaris by email. The Offeror will be responsible and
  ensure that the references submit or reply by e-mail their
  completed response to C. Handley, located at the above address

  of prior related experience in electric bulk power markets,
  and the ability to effectively and efficiently conduct this
  operational audit in accordance with GAGAS. The proposal must
  include previous and/or current experience, within the last
  3 years, where the offeror has performed audits similar in
  terms of size and complexity of this requirement. Higher scores
  will be assigned to those offerors who have demonstrated successful
  experience in electric bulk power markets within the last three
  years. To be acceptable, the services must have been satisfactorily
  performed and at least similar in terms of size and complexity
  to the work required under this contract. Understanding the

  in sufficient and precise detail the offeror's expertise in
  understanding and analyzing independent system operator tariffs,
  market operations and services, and transmission issues. The
  offeror must describe its ability to perform a comprehensive
  and thorough analysis of the electric bulk power market operated
  by the CAISO. Higher scores will be assigned to those offerors
  who demonstrate an understanding and greater knowledge of independent

MARKETS LOOKING AT WEAK OPEN

Equity index futures were pointing to a downside open for 
stocks, continuing the overseas trend, as earnings season winds 
down. With no major economic news on the docket today, corporate 
announcements painted the headlines.

Satellite-TV service provider EchoStar Communications 
(DISH,26,f1) agreed to purchase General Motor Corp.'s (GM,45,f2) 
Hughes Electronics (GMH,15.35,f2) unit for about $31.5 billion 
in cash, stock and assumed debt after top rival News Corp. 
(NWS,29) withdrew its bid for the company. The deal values 
Hughes at $18.44 per share, a 20% premium to its closing price 
on Friday. The transaction would give EchoStar nearly a 91% 
share of the satellite-TV market, which could provoke regulatory 
scrutiny.

Commercial and military aircraft maker Boeing Co. (BA,38,f2) cut 
its sales forecasts for next year by $1 billion to $55 billion 
after failing to secure the government's bid to build the new 
Joint Strike Fighter. However, the company's CEO said that the 
news won't have a ""material impact"" on the aerospace giant's 
2001 outlook. The potentially largest defense contract ever, 
valued at nearly $200 billion, was awarded to Boeing's top rival 
Lockheed Martin (LMT,50,f2) on Friday.

Humana Inc. (HUM,11.20) reported 3Q earnings of $0.18 per share, 
in line with the First Call consensus forecast, on a 1% decline 
in revenues as the health insurer exited non-core markets. 
Humana, like many of the health insurance giants that have 
recently reported strong earnings growth, has benefited from 
increased insurance premiums and cost-reduction efforts.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY 

Bonds rose across the curve as cautious sentiment prevailed 
ahead of this week's economic data, including tomorrow's October 
consumer confidence and 3Q advance Gross Domestic Product on 
Wednesday. Analysts per Bloomberg are looking for a 95.5 reading 
for consumer confidence, down from September's 97.6 level. The 
mean forecast for 3Q GDP is for a decline of 1.0% versus 2Q's 
0.3% increase. The more significant National Association of 
Purchasing Management survey and employment situation reports 
fall on Thursday and Friday, respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS 

European bourses were weaker this morning with softness in 
banking, telecom and pharmaceutical shares. Shares of Morgan 
Crucible Co. (MCRUF,2.75) were being punished after the UK 
manufacturer of wireless components reported worse-than-expected 
profits on slumping demand. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was 
off 0.99% as of 8:52 a.m. EST. The euro was higher against the 
dollar as traders remained cautious ahead of this week's 
economic data in the U.S.

Asian stocks were lower with weakness concentrated in banking 
and technology shares, despite hints from Chartered 
Semiconductor's (CHRT,20,f1) CFO that the company may ship more 
chips in 4Q than 3Q as orders begin to pick up. Banks were lower 
after Japan's Financial Services Agency said that inspections of 
the nation's banks as part of the government's new reform plan 
had commenced. Japan's Nikkei-225 Index closed down 1.69% as 
industrial production for September declined a 
worse-than-expected 2.9% from the previous period's 0.8% 
increase. The Bank of Japan's Policy Board lowered its core 
estimate of economic growth for fiscal year 2001. Also, The yen 
was higher against the dollar. Crude oil climbed as Saudi Arabia 
and the United Arab Emirates indicated that OPEC was ready to 
cut output in the face of slumping demand.

----------------------------------------------------------------

FUTURES WATCH 

In the December Globex futures contract as of 8:52 a.m. EST, the 
S&P 500 Index was down 3.5 points (7 points below fair value) 
while the Nasdaq 100 index was down 1.5 points (10 points below 
fair value). The December DJIA futures contract was down 39 
points (71 points below fair value) and the December crude oil 
futures traded on the NYMEX were up $0.33 at $22.36/barrel.

Please ask each regional RTO heads (all that are being discussed + Mediation) to develop one page memo.  May want a map with current config and a map with FERC model.  Let's plan on doing for September 11 or September 12.  I'll ask Linda Noske to work with Duran's assistant to coordinate.

Also, let's give info on current Interconnection issues.

Finally, Christi, maybe you could develop 5 key regulatory issues.

Your proposed format sounds good to me.  It would be very helpful for us to also hear from them what they're doing and where they're going.  In setting up the meeting, if you can schedule it after the first week (September 3-7), that would work better for me.  The Northeast mediation does not end until September 7.

Dave --

Hope everything finds you well.   

Rick Hill and Chuck Ward called this week on a matter related to Cornhusker.  I had not heard about the potential financial harm from some ERCOT ISO rule changes until this call. 

This made me think.  It probably makes sense to meet with you and/or your team to make sure that Government Affairs is aligned with your business from a Development, Origination, and Generation Investments perspective.  

I'd like to try and meet at least quarterly to go through your business and to update you on recent regulatory developments.  How about sometime in early September?

Jim","
*   **Meeting Planning:** Jim Steffes initiated a discussion about a meeting to align Government Affairs with business perspectives (Development, Origination, and Generation Investments). The meeting is proposed for early September, with W. David Duran and/or his team.
*   **Meeting Format:** James D. Steffes suggested a short presentation (10 pages, 1-hour max) with updates and understanding of current positions and projects, to be delivered by the four individuals. Sarah Novosel agrees, suggesting the meeting be scheduled after the first week of September (Sept 3-7) due to the Northeast mediation ending on Sept 7.
*   **RTO Heads Memo:** Jim directed Christi Nicolay to have each regional RTO head (including those discussed + Mediation) create a one-page memo, possibly including maps of the current and FERC model configurations. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for September 11 or 12. Linda Noske will coordinate with Duran's assistant.

This email thread has been very helpful in understanding the current planning for the upcoming meeting.

Paul, thanks for putting the word out on this, since excluding collateral 
damage from warranty problems from BI will surely impact the risk profile of 
any project if the vendors will not step up to the collateral damage in their 
vendor contracts. 

Jim and Paul, do you know if the underwriters will offer coverage to the 
vendors or turnkey contractors for this issue under their respective 
contracts? GE (who are likely to want to continue to self-insure) can be 
expected to put up a real struggle before choking liability for collateral 
damage down, as  they will likely see it as a material risk issue. I think it 
ought to be added to the form contract discussions with GE as a test case.

I think this is an important enough change in the market that we need to 
develop a common approach or at  least a common understanding accross Enron 
and NEPCO on the issues. 

I will be back in the office next week and chase it up with you guys then.

LATEST MARKET DEVELOPMENT


To Distribution:

Recently, the insurance market has become much more restrictive with its 
terms and conditions and is looking for substantial rate increases, 
especially on property, machinery breakdown and business interruption 
coverages.  For example, because of market conditions and adverse loss 
experience, Enron,s deductible for certain asset classes will be increased 
from $500,000 to $5,000,000 combined per incident of property damage and 
business interruption along with a  (quantify percentage) premium increase.  
In the context of construction risks and the associated operation of new 
facilities, one of the major areas of underwriters, concerns are the nature 
and scope warranties offered by the OEM.

Underwriters are requiring their insureds [Enron] to secure warranties from 
major equipment suppliers, especially where technology risks are involved. 
With the increase in insurance pricing and deductibles across the board,  
underwriters are particularly sensitive to  certain types of technology, and 
capacity will be severely limited or unavailable at any price if no 
warranties are provided.

To ensure that superior, cost-effective insurance programs can be obtained 
for our projects, it is imperative that Enron projects secure manufacturers, 
warranties in the contracts negotiated with equipment suppliers and vendors.. 
Underwriters will require genuine guarantees, not just &token gestures8. They 
will require rights of subrogation against the OEM, which means that we 
cannot agree to a waiver of subrogation for the benefit of  the 
manufacturers. It is the underwriter,s position that the manufacturer is to 
take the risk for their design failure, faulty metallurgy, workmanship, and 
unsuccessful &new8 techniques and the underwriter will provide insurance for 
pure fortuitous loss or damage.

necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file

The attached query lists companies that used plugs in TIS Period 0012 to correct income on their returns.  These plugs to income do not pull thru to the Management Summary Report or Provision Window in TIS, and thus the plugged income is not included in the Period 0012 tax calculations.  

To correct Period 0012 taxes in TIS, you must manually calculate the taxes related to the missing income in TIS and create an OTP (M Class Code 431 100 100/105 for CFIT, and 431 100 120/125 for CSIT) in Period 0012.  Do not include the federal benefit on state taxes when calculating your Federal OTP.  TIS will calculate the benefit on the State OTP automatically.  The OTP's should have already been done when the return was completed and the RTA was analyzed.

Subject: Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical 
snapshot+performance data for model development

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our 
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts 
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following 
the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for 
the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and 
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs 
covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots           Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 
month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month 
end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end 
performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 
month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the

"," Dear Amitava, Scott, Mike, and Eric,

Thank you, Amitava, for the detailed specifications. I appreciate the thoroughness in outlining the data requirements for the Short Term Private Firm Model. I understand the need for comprehensive data, including bankrupt, default, and non-default accounts with the specified quarterly snapshots and performance periods.

I also acknowledge Scott's comments regarding cost-effectiveness and the value of a more robust model. I will await the revised quote from D&B and will remain available to assist in moving forward with the project once the necessary approvals are obtained.

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

Thanks,
